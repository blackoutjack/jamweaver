This document explains the policy specification language, as well as
the structure of policies files and how they are used by the system.


######## Policy structure and semantics ########

A JAM policy is an automaton with JavaScript state predicates labeling 
the edges. Currently JAM limits support to acyclic policies (save for
the implicit self-loops on each state) with a single initial state and
a single final state.

Each edge of a policy automaton specifies a predicate that must evaluate
to true for that edge to be traversed. During the static analysis
portion of JAM, the truth values of these predicates are evaluated with
respect to the abstract (and potentially imprecise) program model; the
result of this static analysis is a rewritten program with
instrumentation that tracks the state of the policy automaton with
regards to the concrete state of the execution.

In either case (static or runtime evaluation), the policy begins in the
initial state. On the evaluation of each program statement, the policy
can remain in the same state (thanks to the aforementioned self-loops on
each state), or if the statement has the ability to transition the
predicate labeling any out-edge from false to true, proceed to the 
destination state of that edge. Transitions are non-deterministic, in
that all policy states that are reachable will be occupied, and can be
the source of subsequent transitions.

To support policies that specify multiple transitions on the same
predicate (such as the write-once policy for the Secure Note
application), policies have the semantics that the state can only
advance one step along any given path on each program statement.

If the (unique) final state of the policy automaton is reachable
in the conservative abstract program model, then either the program
model is refined, or the path(s) leading to potential policy violation
are instrumented in a manner that prevents the violating traces from
being realized at runtime.

######## Policy representation #######

JAM policies are specified as a set of policy automaton transitions.
Each transition is specified on a separate line in one or more policy
files. The transition specifications are automatically accumulated to
generate a single policy object. (Duplicate transition specifications
are ignored.)

For the analysis to be meaningful, the policy must contain one or more
paths from the initial state to the final state. The initial state is
represented by the identifier 0, and the final state by -1. Therefore
the simplest policy is one with a single transition on some predicate
P, as follows.

0,-1: P

A slightly more complex policy (requiring two steps to get from initial
to final state) is represented below, with realistic predicates. Notice
that the intermediate policy state, 1, has one in-edge and one out-edge.

0,1: jam#invoke(#Document#prototype#getElementById)
1,-1: jam#set(#document, "cookie")

The formal structure of an edge specification is as follows.

SourceState,DestState: Predicate

SourceState is an integer identifier of the edge's source; DestState is
likewise for the edge's destination. Predicate is a boolean expression
that is evaluated across each statement in the program being analyzed.
If the analysis determines that a statement may flip the truth value of
the predicate from false to true, then the transition is
non-deterministically followed for that statement.

The initial state must always be indicated by 0, while the final state
is always indicated with -1. Intermediate states must be positive
integers.

Policy specification files may include single-line comments (indicated
by the first non-whitespace character being a #), and may also include
blank lines.


######## Predicate language ########

JAM officially supports predicates indicating weak equality (==), strict
equality (===), corresponding inequality (!=, !==), the JavaScript
instanceof operator, and a set of special extension functions explained
below. It's best to specify strict equality when possible, as this will
be more efficient (by avoiding the analysis of JavaScript's complicated
type coersion rules).

JAM also supports arbitrary conjunctions (but not disjunctions) of any
supported predicates on a given edge. Disjunctions are effectively
supported via the ability to specify multiple disjoint paths through the
policy automaton. Negation (!) of conjuncts is supported, except in the
cases noted below.

Other JavaScript expressions that evaluate to boolean may be tried,
though you may find support to be sketchy. Please let the UW-Madison
team know if there are unsupported constructs you'd like to use.

The currently-implemented extension predicates are as follows.

jam#invoke(#object#location): Returns true if the pointed-to native
  function was invoked (as a function, method, or constructor call) by
  the evaluated statement. Negation of this type of predicate is not
  supported.

jam#set(#object,"member"): Returns true if the specified object member was
  assigned to in the course of evaluation. Negation of this type of
  predicate is not supported.

jam#get(#object,"member"): Returns true if the specified object member was
  retrieved during the course of evaluation. Negation of this type of
  predicate is not supported.

jam#arg(i): Retrieves the value of the actual argument(s) at position i
  of any invoked functions. This function returns a value, and should be
  used in the context of a larger predicate which evaluates to a
  boolean, such as "jam#arg(0) === value". This function will fail (i.e.
  cause the containing predicate to be false) if there no call within
  the statement being analyzed.

jam#arglen(): Retrieves the number of actual arguments for any function
  invocation. This function returns a numeric value, and should be used
  in the context of a larger predicate which evaluates to a boolean,
  such as "jam#arglen() > 1". This function will fail (i.e. cause the
  containing predicate to be false) if there no call within the
  statement being analyzed.

jam#type(ref,"Type"): Returns true if the given reference contains a
  value of type Type (where Type is one of the standard JavaScript types
  Number, Object, String, Undefined or Null).

jam#regextest(/regex/,ref): Returns true if the regular expression
  matches the value (which is coerced to a string).

jam#stringstartswith(ref,"string"): Returns true if the value
  referenced by the first argument is string that begins with the 2nd
  argument. (This predicate type is subsumed by jam#regextest.)

jam#stringcontains(ref,"string"): Returns true if the value
  referenced in the first argument is string that contains with the 2nd
  argument. (This predicate type is subsumed by jam#regextest.)

Predicates may also contain special "wildcard" identifiers beginning
with the ` (backtick) character. These may be used to construct more
complex predicates where the identity of an object is immaterial, except
that it should remain the same across the predicate. The following
example indicates that the "src" member of any HTMLElement object was
assigned to.

jam#set(`x,"src") && `x instanceof #HTMLElement

The use of the # character to indicate native objects can be thought of
as immutable references. If the example above used HTMLElement instead
of #HTMLElement, then the predicate would be evaluating whether `x is
an instance of *whatever* value the HTMLElement identifier points to at
the point in the program being analyzed (since the HTMLElement
identifier may be overwritten in the course of a program). So the #
syntax to represent the immutable location of the native object is
needed for soundness of the analysis.

See doc/RUNNING ("Utilities" section) for instructions for retrieving
the precise name of a given native reference for use in a policy
specification.


######## Seeding predicates ########

Rather than relying on the predicate-learning functionality of JAM
(which is admittedly immature at this stage), it's possible to "seed"
the analysis with predicates that can rule out some counterexamples.
It's important to note that specifying predicates to track in the
analysis is not the same as asserting that these predicates are true.
It simply tells JAM to build the program model with these predicates
included; this means that the analysis will remain sound even if the
user specifies an irrelevant predicate or a predicate that may never
be true. (However, as with policy predicates, it's possible to cause
an aborted analysis by specifying a syntactically flawed seed
predicate.)

Predicates are seeded by providing a seed file as the argument to the -d
flag when running JAM. The seed file format is as follows. Each line
of the file (save for #-prefixed comments and blank lines) should be
either a predicate or a policy edge specification. Including a line with
an edge specification indicates that the predicates that follow should
only be applied to the analysis of policy paths that contain that edge.
For policies with many disjoint paths, this can save a lot of analysis
time. Any predicates listed after a continuous block of one or more
edge specification will be applied to analysis of those edges only.
Predicates listed prior to any edge specifications are applied globally.

The seeded predicates can be of the same form, and using the same JAM
predicate extensions as the policy language. The test cases in
tests/micro-benchmarks/ contain a few example seed files.
